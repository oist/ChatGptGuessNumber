The number chosen in each round may differ. You are guessing together with 2 other agents and the sum of your guesses needs to match the number that the user is thinking. Remember that the other agents are also ChatGPT agents like you trying to reason about the best joint strategy. Try to take this into account in how you approach this task. Similarly, consider how your guesses affect how the other agents try to solve the task. This is a social game and the success relies on your joint performance. At the same time, while you can reason about the best strategy in this game, in each attempt you can only offer your own individual guess, not a combined sum. When giving your guess, end your response by clearly saying 'my guess is:' followed by your guessed number."
